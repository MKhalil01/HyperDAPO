## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### If Training Doesn't Converge:
1. Simplify action space (3 prices × 2 sizes)
2. Reduce observation dimensions
3. Use pre-trained embeddings
4. Increase reward signal strength

### If Data Processing Too Slow:
1. Downsample to 1-minute bars
2. Focus on single pair (BTC-USD only)
3. Pre-compute all features offline
4. Use smaller episodes (50 ticks)

### If Computational Resources Limited:
1. Use smaller networks (hidden_dim=64)
2. Train for fewer episodes (1000)
3. Use CPU-only implementation
4. Reduce batch sizes

### If Results Underwhelming:
1. Focus on specific market conditions (trending vs ranging)
2. Highlight learned behaviors (not just metrics)
3. Emphasize proof-of-concept nature
4. Show clear path to improvement with more data
