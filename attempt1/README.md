=== ATTEMPT 1 ARCHIVE SUMMARY ===

This folder contains the first attempt at training HyperDAPO models.
These models were trained with inadequate data that only included:
- Single point-in-time prices
- Minimal orderbook information (just spread)
- Vague market descriptions
- No historical context or microstructure metrics

Result: Models learned trivial patterns like 'if price is X, place at X-0.50'
instead of sophisticated market dynamics.
