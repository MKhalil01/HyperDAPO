# HyperDAPO - Cryptocurrency Trading LLM Project

## Project Overview

Building and training an LLM using DAPO (Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization) for cryptocurrency limit order execution on the Hyperliquid Exchange.

## Important Notes

- DO NOT TOUCH readme.md
- You can read but do not edit my project_report under any circumstance unless I explicitly ask

## Before you begin

- Before you begin a task, ALWAYS plan first - You should always plan in plan mode
- After planning, save plans to  .claude/tasks/TASK_NAME.md
- The plan should be a detailed implementation plan with reasoning and tasks broken down
- If tasks require extenal knowledge or packages, ensure you research to get the latest knowledge using the task tool for reserach
- Always ask me to review every plan before you implement things, I need to understand every line of code before you write it and be able to advise on if the code is correct or should be changed

## Whilst completing tasks

Update plan as you work

Make sure that as tasks are worked on sufficient detail is given to changes made so that engineers can follow along

Always only complete one step at a time -> STOP AND LET ME REVIEW before proceeding.

When you create scripts, do not create them in the root directory. INSTEAD create them in a folder called 'ClaudeWorkingScripts'. By default any script you create should go into there, except if its purpose is to be run again by the user in which case it should be suitablly allocated into the codebase, ensuring the codebase is kept clean and easy to locate files.

## After completing tasks

Please clean up after yourself -> Ensure you have documented well everything you have done (including your process)

Please delete any unncecsesary files you have created to keep the code base clean
