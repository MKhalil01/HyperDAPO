I want to train an LLM using DAPO to optimally place limit orders on Hyperliquid. This means that for a trader looking to take a trade, they have the ability to set a timeframe, risk %, and approximate Limit buy/sell positions, stop loss positions and take profit positions. I would like the LLM to be able to take in these inputs, and return optimal positions to place these orders. I should be able to prove how effective the entries / exits / levels provided by my model are compared to simply using market orders, vwaps/twaps and maybe other tools.  Finally, I could potentially use the API to get the model to actually place the orders.

For data I have access to https://tardis.dev/ I have subscribed to the monthly hyperliquid plan, meaning I have access to data from 20/04/2025.

I am using an M4 Macbook pro with 48GB ram to develop, and can use vast.ai or runpod to rent GPU power for training. I would like to keep costs at a minimum where possible.
